# Classrooms

## Description

This repository contains the html and css code for a platform that enables administrators to manage courses, classrooms, and student portfolios. Additionally, it facilitates the review system, showcasing the best students on campus each week and providing companies with access to potential employees.

## Features

- **Course Management**: Administrators have the ability to create and manage courses. They can add new courses, update existing ones, and remove courses as needed.

- **Classroom Creation**: Administrators can create classrooms within each course. This allows them to organize students into different sections or groups based on their preferences or requirements.

- **Review System**: The platform includes a review system where users can write and edit reviews on student profiles. These reviews are automatically gathered and used to display and grade the best students on campus each week. This feature provides recognition and motivation for students to excel.
